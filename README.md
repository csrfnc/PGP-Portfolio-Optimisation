This research explores the Mean-Variance-Skewness-Kurtosis (MVSK) framework of portfolio optimisation, which is an extension to the more traditional mean-variance model to include the third and fourth moments (Skewness and Kurtosis) of returns. To deal with these types of portfolios, we invoke the Polynomial-Goal-Programming (PGP) algorithm, which allows the incorporation of multiple conflicting objectives and investor preferences into one objective function. The paper also introduces two risk-adjusted performance metrics, the Omega Ratio, and the Stutzer Index to enhance portfolio evaluation tailored to the MVSK framework.
